# EDA-and-Hypothesis-testing-on-Titanic-Dataset

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
The objective of the project is to survival of the passengers based off the available data, sourced from the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The data was already split into ‘train’ for model building and ‘test’ for validation.

The project contains details and steps taken for Exploratory Data Analysis and testing some Hypothesis on the data.
